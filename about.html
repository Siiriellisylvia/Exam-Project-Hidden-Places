        <h3 class="about-whatwhowhy">WHAT?</h3>
        <p class="about-description">This is a local initiative to showcase an often overlooked district 
            of Barcelona - Poblenou. The area is a mix and match of industrial and traditional. 
            It is home to many sustainable initiatives, creative spaces and much more. 
            It is always changing, always fun.</p>
            <h3 class="about-whatwhowhy">WHO?</h3>
            <p class="about-description">I'm Siiri, and I have lived in the area for many years. It does not stop surprising me! 
            I could spend days just wandering around, and often do. I have listed some of my favourite places 
            on this website.</p>
            <h3 class="about-whatwhowhy">WHY?</h3>
            <p class="about-description">You're always guaranteed to find something interesting, it is a hidden treasure full of creativity 
            and life in every corner. Often some of the most abandoned looking places turn out to be pop-up 
            second hand markets, or pole dancing studios.</p>
        <div class="about-footer">
            <p class="about-footer-text">You never know what you'll find.
                <br><br>
                And that's the beauty of it!
